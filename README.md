## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd hajrshield
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure Supabase
- Create a new Supabase project
- Update `.env` with your Supabase URL and anon key
- Run the database migrations (see Database Setup section)

5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Setup

The application requires several database tables for full functionality:

1. **Users** - User authentication and profiles
2. **Smart Contracts** - Contract audit records
3. **Audit Results** - Vulnerability findings and recommendations  
4. **Transactions** - On-chain transaction analysis
5. **Risk Alerts** - Security alerts and notifications

*Note: Database migration files will be provided upon Supabase connection setup.*
